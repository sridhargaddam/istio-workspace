## User Defined Networks (UDN) in OpenShift using Sail Operator

The implementation of User Defined Networks (UDNs) allows for the creation of multiple isolated networks, moving beyond the
limitation of a single default network for all pods. UDN support is added as part of OVN-Kubernetes in order for the OpenShift
networking solution to be more pluggable, flexible, and modular to cater to customer needs.
